# Drug Classification using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for classifying drugs based on various features using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify drugs, utilizing a dataset with multiple features relevant to drug categorization.

## Contents

- `drug-classification.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all the code, data analysis, modeling, and results.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model building with multiple machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results
